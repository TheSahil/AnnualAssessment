ASRC's world-class researchers study the physical and chemical processes of the atmosphere, land, and water systems, and apply that knowledge to explore the interaction of chemical, physical, geological and biological processes that impact our environment. Through technology transfer and collaboration with state, federal and industrial partners, ASRC enhances New York State's scientific capacity and infrastructure, while advancing the quality of life and economic wellbeing of its citizens.","Q32":"","Q41":"","Q42_1_1":"","Q42_1_2":"","Q42_2_1":"","Q42_2_2":"","Q43_1":0,"Q43_1_TEXT":"","Q43_2":0,"Q43_2_TEXT":"","Q43_3":0,"Q43_3_TEXT":"","Q51_1_1":12,"Q51_1_2":7,"Q51_1_4":9,"Q51_2_1":0,"Q51_2_2":0,"Q51_2_4":0,"Q52_1_1":5,"Q52_1_2":3,"Q52_1_4":2,"Q52_2_1":0,"Q52_2_2":0,"Q52_2_4":0,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_1_2":"","Q53_2_1":"1","Q53_2_2":"","Q54_1_1":"4","Q54_1_2":"","Q54_2_1":"1","Q54_2_2":"","Q61_1_1":"0","Q61_1_2":"","Q61_2_1":"1","Q61_2_2":"","Q61_3_1":"45","Q61_3_2":"","Q62":"","Q63_1_1":"0","Q63_1_2":"","Q63_2_1":"0","Q63_2_2":"","Q63_3_1":"0","Q63_3_2":"","Q63_4_1":"0","Q63_4_2":"","Q63_5_1":"0","Q63_5_2":"","Q63_6_1":"500","Q63_6_2":"","Q63_7_1":"0","Q63_7_2":"","Q64":"","Q65_1":"25","Q65_2":"","Q66":"","Q67":"","Q71_1_1":"5","Q71_1_2":"10","Q71_1_4":"10","Q71_1_5":"0","Q71_2_1":"","Q71_2_2":"","Q71_2_4":"","Q71_2_5":"","Q71_3_1":"","Q71_3_2":"","Q71_3_4":"","Q71_3_5":"","Q81_4":"1.\tSupported by an ESD grant, the xCITE (ExTREME Collaboration, Innovation, & TEchnology) laboratory was established in Spring 2019.
