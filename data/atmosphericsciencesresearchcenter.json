ASRC's world-class researchers study the physical and chemical processes of the atmosphere, land, and water systems, and apply that knowledge to explore the interaction of chemical, physical, geological and biological processes that impact our environment. Through technology transfer and collaboration with state, federal and industrial partners, ASRC enhances New York State's scientific capacity and infrastructure, while advancing the quality of life and economic wellbeing of its citizens.","Q32":"The vision for the center in the coming year is to maintain our traditional strengths but also to seek out and strengthen strategic collaborations in key research areas including two areas that will get renewed focus this year: (i) Boundary Layer and Air Quality and (ii) Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation-Weather-Climate Interactions.","Q41":"","Q42_1_1":"","Q42_1_2":"","Q42_2_1":"","Q42_2_2":"","Q43_1":0,"Q43_1_TEXT":"","Q43_2":0,"Q43_2_TEXT":"","Q43_3":0,"Q43_3_TEXT":"","Q51_1_1":24,"Q51_1_2":6,"Q51_1_4":10,"Q51_2_1":0,"Q51_2_2":0,"Q51_2_4":0,"Q52_1_1":20,"Q52_1_2":7,"Q52_1_4":6,"Q52_2_1":0,"Q52_2_2":0,"Q52_2_4":0,"Q53_1_1":"2","Q53_1_2":"","Q53_2_1":"N/A","Q53_2_2":"","Q54_1_1":"1","Q54_1_2":"","Q54_2_1":"N/A","Q54_2_2":"","Q61_1_1":"0","Q61_1_2":"","Q61_2_1":"N/A","Q61_2_2":"","Q61_3_1":"N/A","Q61_3_2":"","Q62":"","Q63_1_1":"0","Q63_1_2":"","Q63_2_1":"0","Q63_2_2":"","Q63_3_1":"0","Q63_3_2":"","Q63_4_1":"0","Q63_4_2":"","Q63_5_1":"0","Q63_5_2":"","Q63_6_1":"0","Q63_6_2":"","Q63_7_1":"0","Q63_7_2":"","Q64":"","Q65_1":"N/A","Q65_2":"","Q66":"","Q67":"","Q71_1_1":"3","Q71_1_2":"N/A","Q71_1_4":"N/A","Q71_1_5":"N/A","Q71_2_1":"","Q71_2_2":"","Q71_2_4":"","Q71_2_5":"","Q71_3_1":"","Q71_3_2":"","Q71_3_4":"","Q71_3_5":"","Q81_4":"","Q81_5":"","Q81_6":"","Q91":"Strengthen and promote Weather-AI and Data Analytics capabilities at ASRC building on the recently established xCITE laboratory: (1) Promote usage of the xCITE laboratory in ASRC, DAES and the University campus in the area of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning.
