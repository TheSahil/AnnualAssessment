ASRC's world-class researchers study the physical and chemical processes of the atmosphere, land, and water systems, and apply that knowledge to explore the interaction of chemical, physical, geological and biological processes that impact our environment. Through technology transfer and collaboration with state, federal and industrial partners, ASRC enhances New York State's scientific capacity and infrastructure, while advancing the quality of life and economic wellbeing of its citizens.","Q32":"","Q41":"ASRC's annual operating budget is derived from IFR from sponsored funds.

We started out 2020 with plans for upgrades to the observatory including structural repairs as well as electrical upgrades and a roof replacement project. These plans were to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the observatory and also to predicate deployment of several new instruments by Dr. Sara Lance. Several meetings were held with Facilities Management staff as well as the design team from CSARCH. The work was put out to bid in April 2020. Only one bid was received and was determined to be too high. Due to financial constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic it was decided that the scope of the project should be reduced and put back out to bid. We decided to focus on the most urgent need which is the roof replacement. However even with the reduced scope of work we were informed that there were not funds available to move forward this year. The current plan is to have staff from the UALBANY roofing shop come up on Wednesday 9/16/2020 to attempt to refasten the existing roof to get us through the winter.

Sciences Research Center (ASRC), of the State University of New York at Albany, was established on February 16, 1961 by the Board of Trustees of the State University of New York, as a SUNY system-wide resource for developing and administering programs in basic and applied sciences related to the atmospheric environment. ASRC's world-class researchers study the physical and chemical processes of the atmosphere, land, and water systems, and apply that knowledge to explore the interaction of chemical, physical, geological and biological processes that impact our environment. Through technology transfer and collaboration with state, federal and industrial partners, ASRC enhances New York State's scientific capacity and infrastructure, while advancing the quality of life and economic wellbeing of its citizens.","FY2021Vision":"The vision for the center in the coming year is to maintain our traditional strengths but also to seek out and strengthen strategic collaborations in key research areas including two areas that will get renewed focus this year: (i) Boundary Layer and Air Quality and (ii) Aerosol-Cloud-Precipitation-Weather-Climate Interactions.","FY2021Goal1":"Strengthen and promote Weather-AI and Data Analytics capabilities at ASRC building on the recently established xCITE laboratory:\n(1) Promote usage of the xCITE laboratory in ASRC, DAES and the University campus in the area of Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning.
