FDP members of all sectors cooperate in identifying, testing, and implementing new, more effective ways of managing the more than $15 Billion in federal research grants. The goal of improving the productivity of research without compromising its stewardship has benefits for the entire nation. The FDP uniquely offers a forum for individuals from universities and nonprofits to work collaboratively with federal agency officials to improve the national research enterprise. At its regular meetings, faculty and administrators talk face-to-face with decision-makers from agencies that sponsor and regulate research. They hold spirited, frank discussions, identify problems, and develop action plans for change. Then – again working jointly – they test the new ways of doing things in in the real world before putting them into effect.","Q61_2":"COGR serves its membership by: 1. Seeking to balance appropriate levels of accountability with fair recognition of the interests of all parties in research policies and practices; 2. Promoting policies and practices in research and training that fairly reflect the mutual interests and separate obligations of universities and federal and other sponsors; 3. Conducting objective and timely analysis of financial, compliance, administrative and intellectual property issues in research for the benefit of its members, their sponsors and other higher education associations; 4.
