It seeks to accomplish this mission by creating a stimulating and cohesive intellectual environment conducive to the development of multidisciplinary population scholarship, particularly on the Center's signature themes of spatial inequalities and vulnerable populations. Key areas of research include: health and health disparities, immigration, risks to youth and adolescents, spatial inequalities and migration, American families, and social resources and vulnerabilities of the elderly.","Q32":"Our vision is to increase our funding portfolio, forge linkages with other units on campus that don't know about CSDA, attract students from underrepresented minority groups to engage in population-based research, and conduct strategic planning to solidify our larger vision moving forward.","Q41":"","Q42_1_1":"","Q42_1_2":"","Q42_2_1":"","Q42_2_2":"","Q43_1":0,"Q43_1_TEXT":"","Q43_2":0,"Q43_2_TEXT":"","Q43_3":0,"Q43_3_TEXT":"","Q51_1_1":30,"Q51_1_2":5,"Q51_1_4":5,"Q51_2_1":0,"Q51_2_2":0,"Q51_2_4":0,"Q52_1_1":5,"Q52_1_2":1,"Q52_1_4":1,"Q52_2_1":0,"Q52_2_2":0,"Q52_2_4":0,"Q53_1_1":"2","Q53_1_2":"","Q53_2_1":"N/A","Q53_2_2":"","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_1_2":"","Q54_2_1":"N/A","Q54_2_2":"","Q61_1_1":"N/A","Q61_1_2":"","Q61_2_1":"N/A","Q61_2_2":"","Q61_3_1":"N/A","Q61_3_2":"","Q62":"","Q63_1_1":"0","Q63_1_2":"","Q63_2_1":"0","Q63_2_2":"","Q63_3_1":"0","Q63_3_2":"","Q63_4_1":"0","Q63_4_2":"","Q63_5_1":"0","Q63_5_2":"","Q63_6_1":"0","Q63_6_2":"","Q63_7_1":"0","Q63_7_2":"","Q64":"","Q65_1":"N/A","Q65_2":"","Q66":"","Q67":"","Q71_1_1":"4","Q71_1_2":"N/A","Q71_1_4":"N/A","Q71_1_5":"N/A","Q71_2_1":"","Q71_2_2":"","Q71_2_4":"","Q71_2_5":"","Q71_3_1":"","Q71_3_2":"","Q71_3_4":"","Q71_3_5":"","Q81_4":"Two of our associates were awarded grants -- an R03 and an R21 subaward -- from the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). With a few more grants from PDB, CSDA will be competitive for Center grant funding.","Q81_5":"We have just launched a grant review program to encourage our Associates to apply for more grants via PDB at NICHD. For Associates that are interested, we are offering them the opportunity to have someone from the Executive Committee or an expert outside UAlbany review their grant proposal before the submission date. We hope this will result in more applications to NICHD and more funded applications.","Q81_6":"CSDA provided support to Cornell University's population center in developing their portion a larger NIH R25 program called \"Next GenPop,\" which aims to significantly increase the pipeline of scholars from underrepresented backgrounds entering population science. The first five-year funding cycle of NextGenPop will likely be funded by NICHD (its impact score was a 14) and will include five sites -- Wisconsin, Cornell, Duke, UC-Irvine, and Minnesota. When the funding comes through, CSDA will collaborate directly with Cornell in two ways: 1) recruit underrepresented UAlbany students to participate at the Cornell summer program; and 2) CSDA faculty will participate in training and mentoring the students at the summer program. By working with Cornell, in the future funding cycle, CSDA will be competitive to be a host site, which would bring significant visibility to UAlbany's diversity efforts and result in funding from PDB making CSDA competitive for center grant funding. CSDA partnered with the NYS project on COVID-19/MHD, CEMHD, and CURCE on a StAR proposal to develop an infrastructure here at UAlbany to engage underrepresented undergraduates in minority health disparities research. If funded, this would bolster CSDA's chances to be a host site for the NIH R25 proposal and will help CSDA in applying for an NSF grant for Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF 19-582).","Q81_7":"CSDA launched a very successful colloquium series this year. Dr. Courtney Boen from Sociology Department and Population Studies Center of the University of Pennsylvania gave a talk on \"The Roles of State and Local Immigration Policy in Shaping Population Patterns of Health Inequality,\" which was attended by 40 participants. Then we had a micro-sequel event to the very successful RISE conference. It featured a colloquium on \"Challenges and Opportunities for Studying Climate-Related Drivers of Migration\" by Dr. Elizabeth Fussell from the Population Studies and Training Center at Brown University who is the current editor-in-chief of the journal Population and Environment. The colloquium was followed by Lightning talks by Drs. Catherine Lawson, Christopher Thorncroft, and Shao Lin. The event was attended by about 100 participants. The final colloquium was co-sponsored by the Confucius Institute. The talk was delivered by Dr. Yao Lu from the Sociology Department and Population Research Center at Columbia University and was on, \"COVID-19, Anti-China Rhetoric, and Anti-Asian Prejudice.\" It was attended by 30 participants.","Q81_8":"Our final achievement was solidifying our infrastructure for faculty and students to have access to the most recent (Wave V) and all the restricted data from the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). We are the ONLY place on campus at UAlbany where graduate students can analyze these rich, restricted data, which include social, environmental, behavioral, and biological data to examine health and chronic diseases over time of a cohort of over 20,000 adolescents who were in grades 7-12 during the 1994-95 school year and have been followed until 2016-2018 (Wave V). We have recently offered \"cold room\" space to a graduate student from the School of Education so that he can work with restricted data from the Department of Education. He had nowhere else to turn for space on the entire campus. CSDA was equipped for three cold rooms in our UAB 321 suite, but we just lost one space because another unit on campus was \"forced\" to move into our space.","Q91":"Our first priority is to increase our funding portfolio, with an emphasis on applying for grants in the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of NICHD. Expanding funding in the latter agency will increase our ability to be successful in being funding by a future center grant from NICHD.","Q92":"","Q93":"","Q94":"","Q95":"","Q96":"","Q97":"","Q101":"Our second main priority is to forge linkages with other units on campus that do not know about CSDA but could potentially benefit from alignments with population-based researchers and from whom CSDA associates could benefit. We are particularly interested in developing capacity for our research associates to engage in research that links climate change and disasters to the demographics that they are currently studying and that are CSDA’s themes – health, migration, and spatial inequalities. None of our CSDA associates are currently from the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity (CEHC) or from the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences. However, the research that is conducted in both units is focused on disasters and climate change, which has implications for all of the main foci of CSDA.","Q102":"","Q103":"","Q104":"","Q105":"","Q106":"","Q107":"","Q111":"Our third priority is to explore ways to attract students, particularly underrepresented minorities, to engage in

mission is to facilitate and organize population research and education of the highest caliber. It seeks to accomplish this mission by creating a stimulating and cohesive intellectual environment conducive to the development of multidisciplinary population scholarship, particularly on the Center's signature themes of spatial inequalities and vulnerable populations.  Key areas of research include: health and health disparities, immigration, risks to youth and adolescents, spatial inequalities and migration, American families, and social resources and vulnerabilities of the elderly.","FY2021Vision":"Our vision is to increase our funding portfolio, forge linkages with other units on campus that don't know about CSDA, attract students from underrepresented minority groups to engage in population-based research, and conduct strategic planning to solidify our larger vision moving forward.","FY2021Goal1":"Our first priority is to increase our funding portfolio, with an emphasis on applying for grants in the Population Dynamics Branch (PDB) of NICHD.  Expanding funding in the latter agency will increase our ability to be successful in being funding by a future center grant from NICHD.","FY2021Action1":"To achieve this goal, we will:\n1) have a colloquium series this year to showcase successful NICHD grantees from other universities and their research;\n\n2)  organize meetings around each of our core themes -- 1) population health; 2) immigration and internal migration; and 3) spatial inequalities -- with our faculty associates working in those areas to identify opportunities for future collaboration as it fits with the Population Dynamics Branch of PDB.","FY2021Metric1":"We will measure our success by gauging the increase in applications for funding to NICHD and other funding agencies.","FY2021TimeFrame1":"June 2021June 2021","FY2021Goal2":"Our second main priority is to forge linkages with other units on campus that do not know about CSDA but could potentially benefit from alignments with population-based researchers and from whom CSDA associates could benefit.  We are particularly interested in developing capacity for our research associates to engage in research that links climate change and disasters to the demographics that they are currently studying and that are CSDA’s themes – health, migration, and spatial inequalities.  None of our CSDA associates are currently from the College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security, and Cybersecurity (CEHC) or from the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences.
