Established in 1993, we pursue new ways to use technology to address practical problems of information management and service delivery in government. CTG UAlbany has collaborated with hundreds of domestic and international researchers on understanding and applying emerging technologies. At the same time, CTG UAlbany has worked with scores of local, state, federal, and international government bodies as a trusted advisor and facilitator of management and policy decisions to govern the use of new technologies as tools for public service transformation.","Q32":"Work with governments worldwide transforming public services through innovations in technology, policy and management.","Q41":"CTG UAlbany’s financial stability over its 26 years in service as an applied research Institute, has been based on its tenured and experienced faculty, researchers, professional administration and finance and project staff. CTG’s subject matter expertise has an ability to continue to build capacity and capability through its projects and research, while generating the necessary project revenues to support CTG’s operational expenses of over $550K annually.  These annually generated revenues allow CTG to support several project support positions, external UAlbany research faculty, graduate students and its programs or work through MOUs, revenue contracts and research agreements with partners both through the Research Foundation such as federal agencies, corporate sponsors, and international governments or through the University at Albany with state agencies, municipal and local governments, state authorities, and not for profits.   CTG’s FY 2019 PSR state allocation of $971,049  supported 12 FTE’s, during this  fiscal year CTG lost 2 PSR funded positons, one position to WFP committee review of Communications Manager denied for rehiring at $51,000 and the second position to the 15 % state reduction of Sr. Project Assistant at $49,993, totaling $100,993 in permanent state PSR funding.  CTG’s professional staff funded by the PSR allocation are engaged in CTG’s development of new programs and innovations, projects and research proposals, day to day operations, business development activities, academic and community engagement, and other related outreach and dissemination activities within the University and globally.   In 2019, CTG UAlbany conducted 8 Research Foundation sponsored projects and 3 state agency, local government, and not for profits projects simultaneously.  CTG UAlbany revenue generates annually, through various sources, to support CTG’s IFR operational expenditures which for FY 2019 totaled $510,581. CTG’s revenue generation through its various projects supports its annual operational budget of OTPS which includes the following expense categories of  facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, utilities), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, business travel, staff development, conferences, and any other non-PSR  expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. CTG doesn’t receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget.  A unique aspect of CTG’s financial/business model relative to most academic departments and other research units; is that CTG not only relies on its traditional research funded projects, but has many state agency projects, under state MOUs and revenue contracts. These state projects are a part of the strategic business development and financial planning that is the necessary support our annual operational budget. Within this template provided, it doesn’t allow a place for CTG UAlbany to report those state MOUs and Revenue contracts pending, as is the case for pending submitted RF proposals. Therefore, the information is provided here in the narrative.  CTG has several MOUs pending with state agencies such as: 1. NYS BOE’s Future elections at $310,000, 2. NYS BOE Election Remediation Risk at $35,000, along with several other opportunities in the business development, additional work on the project with the United Arab Emirates estimated at an additional $40K and new work with the United Nations for a round two which is in the business development stages. Also, we are submitting a preliminary proposal to IMLS related focused on exploring the role of public libraries as intermediaries of innovation in local and regional contexts.","Q42_1_1":15,"Q42_1_2":1,"Q42_2_1":12.25,"Q42_2_2":0.25,"Q43_1":813839,"Q43_1_TEXT":"IFR 900309 RF IFR Revenue","Q43_2":191167,"Q43_2_TEXT":"IFR 910029 Project Revenue","Q43_3":0,"Q43_3_TEXT":"","Q51_1_1":2,"Q51_1_2":3,"Q51_1_4":1,"Q51_2_1":4,"Q51_2_2":5,"Q51_2_4":5,"Q52_1_1":1,"Q52_1_2":2,"Q52_1_4":1,"Q52_2_1":0,"Q52_2_2":3,"Q52_2_4":5,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_1_2":"1","Q53_2_1":"1","Q53_2_2":"0","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_1_2":"0","Q54_2_1":"0","Q54_2_2":"0","Q61_1_1":"1","Q61_1_2":"2","Q61_2_1":"4","Q61_2_2":"2","Q61_3_1":"10","Q61_3_2":"27","Q62":"1.\tDemircioglu, M.

CTG’s subject matter expertise has an ability to continue to build capacity and capability through its projects and research, while generating the necessary project revenues to support CTG’s operational expenses of over $550K annually.  These annually generated revenues allow CTG to support several project support positions, external UAlbany research faculty, graduate students and its programs or work through MOUs, revenue contracts and research agreements with partners both through the Research Foundation such as federal agencies, corporate sponsors, and international governments or through the University at Albany with state agencies, municipal and local governments, state authorities, and not for profits.   CTG’s FY 2019 PSR state allocation of $971,049  supported 12 FTE’s, during this  fiscal year CTG lost 2 PSR funded positons, one position to WFP committee review of Communications Manager denied for rehiring at $51,000 and the second position to the 15 % state reduction of Sr. Project Assistant at $49,993, totaling $100,993 in permanent state PSR funding.  CTG’s professional staff funded by the PSR allocation are engaged in CTG’s development of new programs and innovations, projects and research proposals, day to day operations, business development activities, academic and community engagement, and other related outreach and dissemination activities within the University and globally.   In 2019, CTG UAlbany conducted 8 Research Foundation sponsored projects and 3 state agency, local government, and not for profits projects simultaneously.  CTG UAlbany revenue generates annually, through various sources, to support CTG’s IFR operational expenditures which for FY 2019 totaled $510,581. CTG’s revenue generation through its various projects supports its annual operational budget of OTPS which includes the following expense categories of  facilities costs (e.g. rent, taxes, utilities), phones, computer equipment and software, graduate students, temp service and term positions, supplies, service contracts, business travel, staff development, conferences, and any other non-PSR  expense needed to operate CTG UAlbany. CTG doesn’t receive an annual OTPS allocation from the Division of Research, instead it revenue generates on its own to support CTG’s OTPS budget.  A unique aspect of CTG’s financial/business model relative to most academic departments and other research units; is that CTG not only relies on its traditional research funded projects, but has many state agency projects, under state MOUs and revenue contracts. These state projects are a part of the strategic business development and financial planning that is the necessary support our annual operational budget. Within this template provided, it doesn’t allow a place for CTG UAlbany to report those state MOUs and Revenue contracts pending, as is the case for pending submitted RF proposals. Therefore, the information is provided here in the narrative.  CTG has several MOUs pending with state agencies such as: 1. NYS BOE’s Future elections at $310,000, 2. NYS BOE Election Remediation Risk at $35,000, along with several other opportunities in the business development, additional work on the project with the United Arab Emirates estimated at an additional $40K and new work with the United Nations for a round two which is in the business development stages. Also, we are submitting a preliminary proposal to IMLS related focused on exploring the role of public libraries as intermediaries of innovation in local and regional contexts.","Q42_1_1":15,"Q42_1_2":1,"Q42_2_1":12.25,"Q42_2_2":0.25,"Q51_1_1":2,"Q51_1_2":3,"Q51_1_4":1,"Q52_1_1":1,"Q52_1_2":2,"Q52_1_4":1,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_2_1":"1","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_2_1":"0","Q55_1_1":"0","Q55_2_1":"2","Q55_3_1":"12","Q56_1_1":"1","Q56_2_1":"0","Q56_3_1":"0","Q56_4_1":"0","Q56_5_1":"0","Q56_6_1":"0","Q56_7_1":"0","Q57_1":"10","Q58_1_1":5,"Q58_1_2":30,"Q58_1_4":20,"Q58_1_5":0,"Q71":"Engage in innovative research and problem solving projects that address societal challenges","Q72":"Strategically plan for and submit research and other project proposals and contracts.","Q73":"Number of proposals and contracts submitted and awarded","Q74":"May 2021","Q75":"CTG Management Team","Q76":"Severity of federal and state budget cuts and therefore external funding available for externally funded research and projects.
