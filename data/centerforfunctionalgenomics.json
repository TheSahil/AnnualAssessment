with the LSRB/RNA Institute: The RNA Institute recently acquired a 10x genomics instrument for single cell sequencing. The LSRB also has an imaging core. There is a strong possibility of funds available for purchase of a Nextseq 2000 sequencer. If the CFG could be moved to the LSRB, co-location can enable us to venture in to new areas such as Spatial transcriptomics which combines single cell, imaging and NGS as is gaining fast popularity. Investigators can also think about multi-omic approaches to science.\nPartnering with ETEC: Joint partnership with the Dept. Environmental & Sustainable Engineering will enable us to target funding opportunities for Metagenomics.","Q152":"1. Our instrumentation is aging and needs upgrading/replacement\n2. Our current operational models are in need of revision: (a) CFG needs to be added to grant funding proposals we support more regularly. (b) Currently it takes a lot of time and effort to track payments between RF, State to reconcile with our own records that are more up to date. (c)Deficit funding does not allow us to forecast our future budgets effectively.\n3. There is no marketing or advisory support for our services.
