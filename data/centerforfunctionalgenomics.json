Our latest instrument is now 5 yrs old and going to be obsolete soon. Newer technologies allow for cost efficiencies and are gaining popularity. If we do not invest in capital equipment, we will loose our resourcefulness to the scientific community.\nWith the past RIFs that have been necessary to address the ongoing budget crises, it becomes harder to complete projects if a staff member is ill.

The data generated by our experiments is complex and deters faculty from doing them which in turn makes them less competitive in grant funding.","Q154":"More partnerships with other departments like Biology, Engineering\nMore collaborative ventures with neighboring area Institutions- we are already a regional resource\nMore partnerships with area biotechnology companies (fee for service, STTRs)","Q155":"We write a lot of support letters for faculty at the university but never find out if the grant was funded (unless we were listed for effort). It would be helpful to have a system where we could track this.\nIt would be helpful to have a better system to track invoice payments. Often our records are waiting for payments to show up on RF or State accounts\nIt would be good to have a small unit at the university that can refurbish/maintaine scientific equipment.
