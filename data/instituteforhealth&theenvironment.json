We have only one state line, and both of the Co-Directors are for budgets purposes within the School of Public Health.  The School of Public Health is increasingly unwilling to share indirect costs with the Institute, and the one faculty member assigned to the Institute has not been successful in obtaining grants.  Furthermore the University has decided to no longer allow me as Director to put funds obtained in expert witness work into an RF account, which has up to now been a major source of support.","Q42_1_1":1,"Q42_1_2":2,"Q42_2_1":1,"Q42_2_2":1,"Q43_1":50000,"Q43_1_TEXT":"RF Federal Grants","Q43_2":45000,"Q43_2_TEXT":"RF Other funds","Q43_3":50000,"Q43_3_TEXT":"Carson Carr fellowships","Q51_1_1":2,"Q51_1_2":0,"Q51_1_4":0,"Q51_2_1":2,"Q51_2_2":0,"Q51_2_4":0,"Q52_1_1":2,"Q52_1_2":0,"Q52_1_4":0,"Q52_2_1":2,"Q52_2_2":0,"Q52_2_4":0,"Q53_1_1":"1","Q53_1_2":"2","Q53_2_1":"N/A","Q53_2_2":"1","Q54_1_1":"0","Q54_1_2":"0","Q54_2_1":"N/A","Q54_2_2":"","Q61_1_1":"0","Q61_1_2":"0","Q61_2_1":"N/A","Q61_2_2":"","Q61_3_1":"N/A","Q61_3_2":"12","Q62":"457.
