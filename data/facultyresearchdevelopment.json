This year, at the suggestion of VPR Dias, we admitted adjunct faculty, non-faculty, and a couple of graduate students which turned out to be disruptive to course's timely progress as these groups do not take proposal writing seriously.; Help organize the CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop held at Binghamton and coordinated participation of UAlbany faculty in it. Because of COVID-19, it was conducted online using Zoom and attended by 12 UAlbany faculty members.; As a member of the SUNY Research Development Group (of AVPRs), helped organize the CDMRP Webinar on May 29 for SUNY Faculty in lieu of the annual SUNY-DOD that was preempted by COVID-19.

Based on the number of proposals submitted by a faculty member over the previous 24-months, nineteen researchers were given “medallions” worth $15K, $7.5K, and $5K. They were encouraged to formulate small group interdisciplinary research projects and submit extramural grant proposals. Four white papers emerged from this effort. They were provided funding and are currently working on preparing proposals, the target date of which has now slipped due to COVID-19.; In coordination with SUNY central office, oversaw the Germination Space program on Internet of Things at UAlbany campus.
