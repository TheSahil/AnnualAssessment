Fifteen faculty members were selected to attend three workshop to help them germinate ideas and form four teams that eventually prepared white papers. The white papers were reviewed by SUNY project PIs and awarded $25K, $8.5K, $8.5K, and $8.5K, on July 16, 2019, to develop federal funding\nproposals within the following 11 months.
